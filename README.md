# SecretFancyAPI
#### Send anonymous love notes. Get matched if the feeling is mutual.

![It's a match!](http://secretfancy.com/images/match.jpg)

This is a GSD (Get S**t Done) project that I did solo in the three days leading up to Valentine's Day 2015. My goal was to provide a simple, anonymous way for 'secret admirers' to share their feelings, and provide a mechanism through which they could be matched with the recipient _only_ if the feeling is mutual.

#### To-do

I acheived my goal of getting the app built and production-ready in three days, but of course there are still some things I'd like to do:

* âœ“ ~~Externalize HTML email templates~~
* Change rate limiting from all time to per day
* Include Linux service script
